Streamlit app that recommends songs from a spotify dataset

Hackaton 14/11 2024

A music recommendation app that recommends songs based on a song selected by the user. 
This is achived by using linear algebra in data_wrangler.ipynb. 
Due to the massive size of the matrix that got created when using the full dataset, we considerably trimmed it down to the 
songs that are deemed most popular. Going from an estimated 30gb to 172mb csv file.
